# Stroke_Prediction_with_Classification_Methods

Stroke is considered to be a burning issue not only in South Asia but also all over the world. Every year, around 16 million people are affected for the first time by stroke, and 5.7 million of them die. Due to population aging, the number of individuals affected by a stroke is increasing over the years. It is generating a lot of controversies when the boom began from 1.1 to 13.7 million between 2000 to 2016. In this classification, I want to predict if someone has any risk of being affected by stroke tests by using Classification methods.

I want to use Random Forest, Decision tree, and SVM algorithm and compare them to find which algorithm will be best for this. By using this classifier I think I may predict 3 to 12 months earlier if someone has any possibility for stroke.
